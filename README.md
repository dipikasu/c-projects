Project 1:
Game:Number Guessing Game
Problem: This is going to be fun!!  We will write a program that generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”. Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “Higher number please”.

When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.


Project 2:
Game 2:Snake, Water, Gun
Snake, Water, Gun or Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game most of us have played during school time. (I sometimes play it even now :) )
program should be able to print the result after you choose Snake/Water or Gun.
